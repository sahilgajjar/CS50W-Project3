# CS50W-Project3

The 4th project of cs50 web programming with python and javascript.
Here we fetch, submit and update the mail content and it's various attributes with giving user an interface to do those things.
The main thing is there is no page refresh occuring while switching between different tabs and stuff because it is entirely handled by the javascript behind.
